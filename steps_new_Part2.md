# Mission-2:  With the basic Loopback Concepts out of the way - Lets flesh out a real api that can be consumed.

### Note Ladies: Verify Atom auto opens when you type atom . in your terminal if yes then your good. Else, create sim link with the following ```ln -s /Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/atom.sh /usr/local/bin/atom```

### System Flow:
- Install node.js, npm, and loopback.io
- Scaffold a new Loopback Application - follow Mission-1
- Create the data models from the class diagram
- Add relations to the models
- Define the Access Control List(ACL)
- Test the Application
- Push code to github
- Add an Application Manifest for Deployment

### Step-1
- Create a new folder in your project folder called team_seguin_demo2 and re-run Mission-1.

### Step-2
Before you start Mission-2 create a new class diagram.  Head to draw.io and select a new uml model and re-create the diagram as seen in the image.

### Begin with creating a new directory in your projects folder on your desktop called team_seguin_demo2 then at your terminal run

- ```git clone git@github.com:seguin-util/team_seguin_demo2.git```
- Now open the new folder by typing ```atom .```
- This will show all files in the folder including the ***steps_new2.md*** file with all the instructions on how to complete this exercise.


### Step 1
- From terminal create a new model ```lb model``` and configure the class from the class diagram
- Start with the Student Model as base class select the user model and add properties as specified in the class diagram






### Done! Great Job Jordyn and Elilita your first api server.
